# Decision Maker Flutter App

## Introduction

Welcome to the Decision Maker Flutter cross platform application! This cross platform application is designed to assist users in making decisions based on random or luck factors. Whether you need to roll a dice, flip a coin, or generate a random number within a specified range, this app has got you covered. Each randomness factor has its dedicated page/screen for a user-friendly experience.

**Note: This project is currently in the development process, and additional randomness factors will be added in the future.**

## Features

### 1. Dice Roll

The Dice Roll feature allows users to simulate rolling a standard six-sided die. It's perfect for situations where a simple random choice is needed, such as deciding who goes first in a game.

To use the Dice Roll feature, navigate to the "Dice Roll" section in the app and tap the screen to roll the virtual die.

### 2. Coin Flip

The Coin Flip feature enables users to make binary decisions by flipping a virtual coin. This is great for scenarios where a yes/no or heads/tails decision is required.

To use the Coin Flip feature, go to the "Coin Flip" section in the app and tap the screen to flip the virtual coin.

### 3. Random Number Generator

The Random Number Generator allows users to generate a random number within a specified range. This feature is handy for situations where a numerical decision is needed, such as picking a random page in a book.

To use the Random Number Generator, visit the "Random Number" section, input the desired range, and tap the "Generate" button.
